        <p>Hello everyone, My name is Herbert, from Hong Kong. Here is a showcase of the photographs I have been taking in these years. The photo albums are rearranged as if they are chapters of a novel, and they will be reviewed from time to time. Everything here is organized by Herbert - from every photo shot to the website presentation. I find it a way to express my passion, sincerity and uniqueness.</p>
        <br>
        <p>All of the photographs here, except those in the <a href="<?php echo base_url(); ?>album/travel/">Travel</a> album and some in the <a href="<?php  echo base_url(); ?>album/misc/">Misc</a> album, are taken in Hong Kong.I particularly like the <em>magic hours</em> in Hong Kong, and you can find how captivating it is here, especially when you reach here accidentally by googling maybe <em>Herbert photography</em> from outside Hong Kong.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Recently I'm doing some reading and researching on photography-related subjects to get prepared for upcoming portofolio topics. Expect <em>aerial</em>, <em>360 photographs</em>, and series of new elements to come in the later time of this year!. If you wanna become one of the lucky ones to appear in the <a href="<?php echo base_url(); ?>album/misc/">Portraits</a> album, or if you come up with great ideas, don't hesitate to reach me at:</p>
