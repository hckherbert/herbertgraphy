<div class="about">
    <p>In 2008, I got my first SLR camera. Since then I developed an interest in photography. Here is a showcase of the photographs that I’ve been taking. Everything here is organized by me, Herbert - from every photograph, layout design and  technical stuff like programming etc. of the site. I see it a way to present my passion for what I’ve been doing  - passion, sincerity and uniqueness. This is what HerbertGraphy wants to convey.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I read books particularly in art, philosophy, history and photography to get inspirations. I believe reading is one of the best resources to keep my mind fresh, when people are told to pursue new technologies. It doesn’t mean they both conflict with each other; it’s just choosing the right thing to do at the right time.</p>
    <br>
    <p>All of the photographs here, except those in the travel category,  are taken in Hong Kong - where I was born and where I will keep staying in. I particularly  like the dusk in Hong Kong, and you can find how captivating it is here, especially when you <em>accidentally</em> reach HerbertGraphy by googling from somewhere else. My camera has also followed me to Japan, Turkey, Nepal, Poland, France, Italy and Australia.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I’m glad to have received very positive feedbacks from my friends on the photographs. I’ll keep HerbretGraphy up-to-date, and bring more surprises from time to time. I enjoy most when I’m asked to take portrait photos. If you wanna become one of the lucky ones who appear here, just ask <em>her</em> out:</p>
