        <p>Hello everyone, I'm Herbert from Hong Kong, a post-80's guy who's fond of photography. Here is a showcase of the photographs I have been taking in these years. The photo albums are rearranged as if they are chapters reviewed by editors. Everything here is organized by Herbert - from every photo shot to the website presentation. I find it a way to express my passion, sincerity and uniqueness.</p>
        <br>
        <p>All of the photographs here, except those in the <a href="../album/travel/">travel</a> category, are taken in Hong Kong. I particularly like the <em>magic hours</em> in Hong Kong, and you can find how captivating it is here, especially when you reach here accidentally by googling maybe <em>Herbert photography</em> from outside Hong Kong.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Iâ€™ll keep HerbretGraphy up-to-date, and give you surprises from time to time. I enjoy most when taking portrait photos. If you wanna become one of the lucky ones to appear here, or if you come up with great ideas, just reach me at:</p>
