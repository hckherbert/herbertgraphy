        <p>I am Herbert, a photography lover from HK, and here is a showcase of the photographs I have been taking in these years. The photo albums are recompiled so they would be presented in the best form. Everything here is organized by me - from every photograph to the website constructions. I see it a way to show my passion, sincerity and uniqueness.</p>
        <br>
        <p>All of the photographs here, except those in the travel category, are taken in Hong Kong. I particularly like the <em>magic hours</em> in Hong Kong, and you can find how captivating it is here, especially when you have accidentally googled HerbertGraphy from somewhere else.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I am glad to have received very positive impressions on the photographs from my friends. . Iâ€™ll keep HerbretGraphy up-to-date, and bring more surprises from time to time. I enjoy most when taking portrait photos. If you wanna become one of the lucky ones to appear here, or if you come up with great ideas, just reach me at:</p>
