    <p>I said to Love,</p>
    <p>"It is not now as in old days</p>
    <p>When men adored thee and thy ways</p>
    <p>All else above;</p>
    <p>Named thee the Boy, the Bright, the One</p>
    <p>Who spread a heaven beneath the sun,"</p>
    <p>I said to Love.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I said to him,</p>
    <p>"We now know more of thee than then;</p>
    <p>We were but weak in judgment when,</p>
    <p>With hearts abrim,</p>
    <p>We clamoured thee that thou would'st please</p>
    <p>Inflict on us thine agonies,"</p>
    <p>I said to him.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I said to Love,</p>
    <p>"Thou art not young, thou art not fair,</p>
    <p>No faery darts, no cherub air,</p>
    <p>Nor swan, nor dove</p>
    <p>Are thine; but features pitiless,</p>
    <p>And iron daggers of distress,"</p>
    <p>I said to Love.</p>
    <br>
    <p>"Depart then, Love! . . .</p>
    <p>- Man's race shall end, dost threaten thou?</p>
    <p>The age to come the man of now</p>
    <p>Know nothing of? -</p>
    <p>We fear not such a threat from thee;</p>
    <p>We are too old in apathy!</p>
    <p>Mankind shall cease.--So let it be,"</p>
    <p>I said to Love.</p>
