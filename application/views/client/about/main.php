        <p>Hello everyone, I'm Herbert from Hong Kong, a post-80's guy who's fond of photography. Here is a showcase of the photographs I have been taking in these years. The photo albums are rearranged as if they are chapters reviewed by editors. Everything here is organized by Herbert - from every photo shot to the website presentation. I find it a way to express my passion, sincerity and uniqueness.</p>
        <br>
        <p>All of the photographs here, except those in the <a href="../album/travel/">travel</a> category, are taken in Hong Kong. I particularly like the <em>magic hours</em> in Hong Kong, and you can find how captivating it is here, especially when you reach here accidentally by googling maybe <em>Herbert photography</em> from outside Hong Kong.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Iâ€™ll keep HerbretGraphy up-to-date, and give you surprises from time to time. I enjoy most when taking portrait photos. If you wanna become one of the lucky ones to appear here, or if you come up with great ideas, don't hesitate to reach me at:</p>
