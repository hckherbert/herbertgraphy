        <p>Hello everyone, I'm Herbert from Hong Kong, a young guy who's fond of photography. Here is a showcase of the photographs I have been taking in these years. The photo albums are rearranged as if they are chapters reviewed by editors. Everything here is organized by Herbert - from every photo shot to the website presentation. I find it a way to express my passion, sincerity and uniqueness.</p>
        <br>
        <p>All of the photographs here, except those in the <a href="<?php echo base_url(); ?>album/travel/">Travel</a> album and some in the <a href="<?php  echo base_url(); ?>album/misc/">Misc</a> album are taken in Hong Kong.I particularly like the <em>magic hours</em> in Hong Kong, and you can find how captivating it is here, especially when you reach here accidentally by googling maybe <em>Herbert photography</em> from outside Hong Kong.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Iâ€™ll keep this portfolio site up-to-date, and give you surprises from time to time. If you wanna become one of the lucky ones to appear in the <a href="<?php echo base_url(); ?>album/misc/">Portraits</a> album, or if you come up with great ideas, don't hesitate to reach me at:</p>
