    <div class="content"><span class="useCap">I</span>t was a chilly morning. Snow was falling on <em>Mariacka Street</em>, which is one of the most charming streets in Poland. Shops and restaurants were mostly close,there were nothing to capture but waiting to see if something would happen. Then an old man in drak grey jacket passed the street; the trolley that he was taking with suggested that he was probably an old man in limited financial condition. While he was taking a glance at the camera, with the snow making a perfect color contrast with his jacket, I didn't hesitate to capture the frame, with a f/1.4 aperture to further enhance the snowy sight.</div>
